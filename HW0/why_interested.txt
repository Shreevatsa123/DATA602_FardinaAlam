I am interested in DATA 602 because I worked as a data engineer for last 2 years and as part of my role I had the opportunity to handle huge volume of IoT, transaction as well as PII data and I have come to one very simple conclusion - everything is about the data. A great ML algorithm or a better optimization technique would be nothing if the data provided is not up to the mark. I want to learn how to improve upon the skills of data transformation and cleaning I acquired as a Data engineer and apply them here in this course and the projects I plan to build as part of the course. I am hoping to learn not just the principals of data science but also what to keep in mind when using these in an ethical way.
